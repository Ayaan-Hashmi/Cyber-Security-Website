        Did you realize you gave all that away just by filling out a form? 
        Don't worry, I'm not storing any of it. But others might be! 
        Do you also realize that you're downloading a file from a random website? 

        A Friendly Heads-Up:

        - Think twice before sharing your personal information online, especially for small perks or extras.
        - Be cautious when downloading files from sources you don't trust.
        - Remember, if a website isn't secure, your data might end up in the hands of third-party actors.
        - Don't blindly trust website developers or forms asking for personal details.


        Stay smart, stay safe, and keep your info secure!
