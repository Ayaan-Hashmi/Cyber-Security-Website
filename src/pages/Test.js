  intro:
    "The primary goal of file input validation is to ensure that users can only upload files that are deemed acceptable by the application. The author initially considered a manual check after file upload but quickly recognized the inefficiencies and potential user frustration associated with this method. Instead, they discovered the `accept` attribute of the HTML `<input>` element, which allows developers to specify which file types are permissible.",

  conclusion:
    "Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Implementing effective cybersecurity measures is particularly challenging today because there are more devices than people, and attackers are becoming more innovative. A successful cybersecurity approach has multiple layers of protection spread across the computers, networks, programs, or data that one intends to keep safe. In an organization, the people, processes, and technology must all complement one another to create an effective defense from cyber attacks.",
